# Emerging-Sys-Arch-Tech.

1) Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The project that was being worked on was an interactive thermostat software that controls hardware components. Furthermore it would send data to SysTecâ€™s server software over Wi-Fi.

2) What did you do particularly well?

What I did particularly well in this project was keep the code organized and properly commented so anyone that wanted to further work on it or edit it would have a much easier time reading it.

3) Where could you improve?

I could improve on the implementation of the code. Fix up memory resource usage in addition to making said code more efficient and streamlined.

4) What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

The main tool and resource that are being added to support the network involve implementing a UART to simulate data being sent to the server with the addition of security features that would be implemented over Wi-Fi.

5) What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

The main skill that would be able to transfer to other projects mainly involves applying proper code management in addition to resource management in order for as many boards as possible to use said code.

6)How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I make this project maintainable through the use of proper function implementation, readable through proper comments, and adaptable by having said code be able to be changed and more adaptable.
